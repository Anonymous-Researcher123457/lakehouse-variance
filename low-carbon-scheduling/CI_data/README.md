## Data Usage and Compliance

This project relies on carbon-intensity data provided by Electricity Maps.

To remain compliant with the Electricity Maps Terms of Service, this repository does not include copies of Electricity Maps carbon-intensity data. 
Instead, users are expected to obtain the required data directly from the official sources.

The experiments in this project were conducted using the following datasets:

- `CY_2024_5_minute.csv`
- `GB_2024_5_minute.csv`
- `BR_2024_5_minute.csv`
- `AU_2024_5_minute.csv`

To replicate the results, users should download the corresponding datasets from Electricity Maps and place them into this directory.

The data relied upon in this project can be accessed here:

Before using or extending this project, please review the Electricity Maps Terms of Service in full to confirm compliance.
